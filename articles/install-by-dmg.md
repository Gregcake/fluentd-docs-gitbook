# Install By Dmg

This article explains how to install td-agent, the stable Fluentd distribution package maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/), on MacOS X.

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for flexibility, with performance sensitive parts written in C. However, casual users may have difficulty installing and operating a Ruby daemon.

That's why [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasuredata.com/) is providing **the stable distribution of Fluentd**, called `td-agent`. The differences between Fluentd and td-agent can be found [here](http://www.fluentd.org/faqs).

For MacOS X, we're using the OS native .dmg Installer to distribute td-agent.

## Step1: Install td-agent

Please download the `.dmg` file from here, and install the software.

## Step2: Launch td-agent

You can launch `td-agent` with `launchctl` command. Please make sure the daemon started correctly from the log \(`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`\).

```text
$ sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/td-agent.plist
$ less /var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log
2013-04-19 16:55:03 -0700 [info]: starting fluentd-0.10.33
2013-04-19 16:55:03 -0700 [info]: reading config file path="/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf"
```

**Your configuration file** is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`. Your plugin directory is at `/etc/td-agent/plugin`. In case you want to stop the agent, please execute the command below.

```text
$ sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/td-agent.plist
```

## Step3: Post Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and route them to stdout \(`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`\). You can post sample log records using the curl command.

```text
$ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
$ tail -n 1 /var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log
2013-04-19 16:51:47 -0700 debug.test: {"json":"message"}
```

## Uninstall td-agent

td-agent for Mac doesn't provide uninstallation app unlike rpm / deb. If you want to uninstall td-agent from your Mac, remove these files / directories.

* /Library/LaunchDaemons/td-agent.plist
* /etc/td-agent
* /opt/td-agent
* /var/log/td-agent
